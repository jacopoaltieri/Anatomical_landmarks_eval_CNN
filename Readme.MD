# Identification of anatomical landmarks using CNN

## Introduction
The task of this project is to develop a CNN to identify 14 anatomical landmarks from lateral cephalometric radiographs.

## Cephalometry principles
To carry out cephalometry, the X-ray tube is placed at 1.5 meters away from the mid sagittal plane, while the detector is at 15 cm on the other side.
In a lateral cephalometric radiograph, the one analyzed by this CNN, the X-ray beam is perpendicular to the patient's sagittal plane in a [Natural head position](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_head_position). This setup allows the presence of an extracranial line (*true vertical line*), which can be used as a reference line.
